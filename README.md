Cobblemon: Parting Gifts
=======

Repository for Cobblemon: Parting Gifts.

This Cobblemon sidemod adds a highly configurable Reward system for releasing Pokemon. Inspired by the mechanic in Pokemon Legends.

Rewards are generated by rolling Loot Tables assigned with the Species and one of its Types, aswell as a Global table that applies to all releases.
- Note that all applicable tables are rolled when a Pokemon is released. (Global, one Type, Species-specific)

Additional Loot Conditions, Functions, and Entries are available for Release Reward Loot Tables.
- [examples for everything can be found in this repository.](<https://github.com/anabsolutesloth/cobblemonreleaserewards/tree/main/src/main/resources/data/releaserewards/loot_table/rewards>).

Default configurations include a Global table with Effort Wings aswell as XP Candies, and a Species table for Gimmighoul.
