Cobblemon: Parting Gifts
=======

Repository for Cobblemon: Parting Gifts.

This Cobblemon sidemod adds a highly configurable Reward system for releasing Pokemon. Inspired by the mechanic in Pokemon Legends: Arceus.

Rewards are generated by rolling Loot Tables assigned with the Species and one of its Types, aswell as a Global table that applies to all releases.
- Note that all applicable tables are rolled when a Pokemon is released. (Global, one Type, Species-specific)

Additional Loot Conditions, Functions, and Entries are available for Release Reward Loot Tables.
- [examples for everything can be found in this repository.](<https://github.com/anabsolutesloth/cobblemonreleaserewards/tree/main/src/main/resources/data/releaserewards/loot_table/rewards>)

Default configurations include a Global table with Effort Wings aswell as XP Candies, and a Species table for Gimmighoul.
